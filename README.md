# React TypeScript project "Phone Catalog"

Hello, I want present to you online phone shop. 
It helps customer to look at the product, read more about it and choose products that close to them.

# Technologies that was implemented in this projects
First of all, the project was created with using  React library and Typescript, also I implemented BEM methodology, that is really important not only for better structure of the page but for other developers who will interact this page. According to design I implemented sliders , using react swiper library, to give customer possibility to scroll between products and have more convenient opportunity at them all even on small screen. You can switch between pages by using header buttons, that was developed with React Router. This is really big project, so , to aboid props drilling i used React Context, so all of generall data stores there. If you want to filter some products by age or title, and use precise amount of products that displayed on the screen and then share it to your friend, you could do it, because of search params, that implemented here. To remember things that u added in your favourites or cart also was implemented LocaleStorage. 

This project could be displayed on different screens, it doesn't matter what extension it has, and it was created by using Mobile first design.
